    <div class="step">
      <h2>🛒 Step 1: See Something, Want Something</h2>
      <p>You know that moment when you see something and your brain goes "YAAAAS!" but your bank account is like "Girl, no." Don't worry, we've all been there! Click that beautiful item and reserve it like the financially responsible adult you're pretending to be. 💪</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>📆 Step 2: Choose Your Payment Adventure</h2>
      <p>Weekly payments? Bi-weekly? Monthly? We've got more options than a fancy restaurant menu! Pick what works for YOUR wallet, not what some financial guru on TikTok says you should do. This isn't about being perfect, it's about being real! 🤷‍♀️</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>💸 Step 3: Pay Like a Boss (A Broke Boss, But Still a Boss)</h2>
      <p>No credit check because honestly, we already know your score is probably "questionable." No late fees because life happens (and sometimes you forget it's Tuesday). Just friendly reminders that won't make you feel like a failure at life! 😌</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>📦 Step 4: GET YOUR STUFF!</h2>
      <p>Once you've made all your payments (look at you being all responsible!), we ship that beautiful item straight to your door. It's like Christmas morning except YOU bought yourself the present over several weeks like the smart cookie you are! 🎁✨</p>
